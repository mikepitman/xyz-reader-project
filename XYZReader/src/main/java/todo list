main activity must use coordinatorLayout
change colour of app bar and text therein, to be more legible
change how the images on landing page are displayed, to fill the whole top part of the card
raise the app bar when the page moves beneath it

look at putting in a progress bar / spinner when loading detail page, it's really slow
make the book details slide under the app bar, rather than app bar disappear up the screen
make the 'share' button a FAB, on the junction between the image and book title
make the text 'justified' to that there aren't hanging lines everywhere
text size should link to device-specified font, for people without good eyesight

check the app looks ok in landscape mode, as well as tablet mode
define colour scheme in styles.xml
